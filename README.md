# Update MIDAS-GARCH

In this project, I have made an update to the mfGarch package for estimating MIDAS-GARCH models. The main modification I have implemented is that in choosing the distribution of residuals, in addition to the Normal distribution, you can also opt for the t-Student distribution and the GED distribution. For estimating the parameters of the MIDAS-GARCH model, I relied on the original functions of the mfGarch package.
